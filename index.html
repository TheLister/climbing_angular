"My Pompadour Fade" is part of the area's upper section which also houses my first problem in the area, "Cosmic Expansion". "Winner, Winner" is located on the Chicken Dinner boulder and feels quite similar to the Refuge classic "Steak Dinner" (Hence the play on name). "The Riley Shuffle" and "Riley's Roof" are both located in the main area, and named after my aging dog who just can't make the long hikes with me anymore. There is plenty of potential for new problems ranging from V5 to V10+ in the same area, and I'll be making several more trips out here this year.</p>
